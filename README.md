# ViaBungee

> [!WARNING]  
> This currently only works if **both client and server are below 1.20.2**.

See https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaVersion for the main project. Note that we recommend putting ViaVersion on your 
backend servers, or switching to [Velocity](https://github.com/PaperMC/Velocity) or [ViaProxy](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaProxy) as ViaBungee is fairly unstable due to platform limitations.

## To get started

- Download the latest jar from https://hangar.papermc.io/ViaVersion/ViaBungee and put it into your BungeeCord plugins
  folder
- Download ViaVersion from https://viaversion.com/ (and other addons if needed) and put them into
  the `plugins/ViaVersion/` folder
